# Construction_work_order
The Construction Work Order Generator is a Streamlit-based web application that automates the creation of detailed work orders for construction projects. Using Groq's DeepSeek R1 LLM, the app takes user inputs (client details, labor, materials, and costs) and generates a structured work order document in seconds.
